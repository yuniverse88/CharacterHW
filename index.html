            <h3 class="lb_heading">Detective William Murdoch</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">
                William Murdoch is a handsome young Victorian-era detective who uses radical forensic techniques for the time, including fingerprinting and trace evidence, to solve some of the city's most gruesome murders.
        </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Using his self-taught detective and forensic skills, Murdoch solved a number of crimes and came to the attention of his superiors. He was eventually raised to the level of detective.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Dr. Julia Ogden</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
            Julia Ogden is a pathologist who works with the Toronto police force. She's a forward-thinking, modern woman who can be quite blunt and straightforward.
    </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
            She shares Murdoch's fascination with forensic science and has become one of his staunchest allies, though their burgeoning relationship was quashed by her marriage to Dr. Darcy Garland.

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Inspector Brackenreid</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Brackenreid is a gruff, no-nonsense, by-the-book Inspector who is completely lacking in imagination. He is prone to quick judgments based on stereotypes and first impressions.
        </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                While he is often embarrassed by Murdoch's eccentric approach to policing, he's come to realize it does get results. Not afraid to get his hands dirty, Brackenreid is known to use force - if necessary - to get results.

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Constable George Crabtree</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">
                George Crabtree is a young constable who's eager to be a detective like Murdoch, but lacks the formal education to do so.
        </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Murdoch admires his enthusiasm, openness to new ideas and loyalty, but is frustrated by Crabtree's inability to grasp some of the more elusive scientific concepts.
                But all told, they make a good team.

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Rebecca James</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">
                A recent arrival in Toronto, Rebecca James is a young woman of humble origins who cleans the city morgue.
        </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                However, Rebecca’s resourcefulness, hunger for knowledge and interest in anatomy, forensics and the activities at the morgue quickly bring her to the attention of Dr. Ogden. Under Ogden’s mentorship, a friendship develops that extends to the rest of the Station No. 4 team.
